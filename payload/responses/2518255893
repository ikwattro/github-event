This would allow a box running a reverse proxy into the flannel network to route to ips on the flannel subnet without reserving an ip range. This is a pretty low priority feature but it would be quite useful."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-16T20:41:48Z","org":{"id":3730757,"login":"coreos","gravatar_id":"","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/orgs\/coreos","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3730757?"}}
