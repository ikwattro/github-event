    $value = isset($this->properties[$name]) ?: null;

will always evaluate to true or null.

Leaving out the middle part of PHP's ternary operator will make it equal to the first part, which is a boolean. I can send in a pull request, but I don't know where and how you would want those.

The following should work:

    $value = isset($this->properties[$name]) ? $this->properties[$name] : null;
                        )

                            [body] => Hi,

Currently the unique generator keeps the already used elements as array values and performs the lookup with `in_array` to assert that the generated value has not already been used. This operation is a O(n) operation which becomes slower in time for large datasets generation.

I refactored this operation to uses array indexes instead, which will leads to hash table lookups that are O(1) operations.

I did a little benchmark generating 10k unixTimes, the generation time is decreased from 1.77 seconds to 0.37 seconds.

I googled about facebook appending the "#_=_" hash by design as a security issue fix if redirect_uri is not fixed. In my fb app i have set site URL to http://localhost and i left valid oauth redirect link empty because i get an error.

How can I fix this appending? I have integrated hwiouth with fos user bundle bridge.

                            [body] => It is quite easy with the Cypher notation to define tree structure thanks to identifiers: 

    (user:User {email:email} *5)
    (user)-[:filespace *1..1]->(fs:FileSpace *5)
    (fs)-[:contains *1..n]->(file:File {name: randomNumber} *10)
    (fs)-[:contains *1..n]->(folder:Folder {name: randomNumber} *5)
    (folder)-[:contains *1..n]->(file2:File {name: randomNumber} *10)

However with Yaml definition it is something else. If we take an example of something that currently as expected: 

    connection:
      scheme: http
      host: localhost
      port: 7474
    
    nodes:
      users:
        label: User
        count: 5
        properties:
          email: email
      fileSpaces:
          label: FileSpace
          count: 5
      files: 
          label: File
          count: 10
    
    relationships:
      fileSpaceRels:
        start: User
        end: FileSpace
        type: FILESPACE
        mode: 1..1
      fileSpaceContainsFiles: 
        start: FileSpace
        end: File
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n

We see that relationships start and end nodes are described based on the label rather than on the identifier like for the Cypher Query. Adding folders in the later example should be quite easy. However, introducing files inside folder is another story as the relationship description will match files at the root and files that should be in folders at the same time. 

It is somehow possible to have a tree-like structure by cheating using new intermediate labels for nested files. But it's really messy has we cannot make clean Cypher on that tree afterward: 

    connection:
      scheme: http
      host: localhost
      port: 7474
    
    nodes:
      users:
        label: User
        count: 5
        properties:
          email: email
      fileSpaces:
        label: FileSpace
        count: 5
      files: 
        label: File
        count: 10
      folders: 
        label: Folder
        count: 5
      firstLvlFiles:
        label: FirstLvlFile
        count: 15
    
    relationships:
      fileSpaceRels:
        start: User
        end: FileSpace
        type: FILESPACE
        mode: 1..1
      fileSpaceContainsFiles: 
        start: FileSpace
        end: File
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n
      fileSpaceContainsFolders: 
        start: FileSpace
        end: Folder
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n
      foldersContainsFirstLvlFiles: 
        start: Folder
        end: FirstLvlFile
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n

                            [body] => The current use of `~x.y.z` notation in `composer.json` makes it impossible, for example, to use a version of Monolog greater than `1.3.x`. Using `~x.y` instead would allow library users to use newer versions of these dependencies while still requiring that the minimum to be required.

This was working the way I suggest until [this commit](https://github.com/neoxygen/neo4j-neoclient/commit/1844f64613cf549badd3bfae2a83fdf50929e0e6), which introduced more strictness.

                            [body] => The current use of `~x.y.z` notation in `composer.json` makes it impossible, for example, to use a version of Monolog greater than `1.3.x`. Using `~x.y` instead would allow library users to use newer versions of these dependencies while still requiring that the minimum to be required.

This was working the way I suggest until [this commit](https://github.com/neoxygen/neo4j-neoclient/commit/1844f64613cf549badd3bfae2a83fdf50929e0e6), which introduced more strictness.

                            [body] => Hi thanks for the report. I'm ok for allowing less strict versions for monolog. However currently I'm not ok for allowing less strictness for the symfony components. I'm aware of some warnings that can occur, for the yaml component for e.g. .

We can for the sf components discuss it when I have reviewed all the components in the 2.7-dev version ?

If you can modify for now only the monolog dep, I'm ok to merge it

* possibility to assign the percentage of relationships when having a x..n cardinality : 

A new property `percentage` can be added to the relationship yaml definition, with a default of 100.

* Seed

* 5 default values always returned for all types, the implementation should be planned

* possibility to define property constraints and indexes 

```
// for constraints
(person:Person {firstname!: firstName})

// for indexes
(person:Person {firstname?: firstName})
```

                            [body] => Hi,

When running the example on a https host (e.g. with the heroku deploy button) , errors are triggered because resources included in template use http links.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/nVsAEtO.png)

There are two solutions to avoid this problem : 

* Change all links in the templates folder and all drivers examples.
* Add a script to detect https and redirect to http

This P.R. proposes the second solution.

                            [body] => Currently, it is not possible to use identifiers in the result to select nodes to work on, for e.g. : 

```MATCH (n:User)-[:FOLLOWS*2]->(fof) RETURN n, collect(fof) AS friendOfFriend;```

with the above query you can not take only the friendOfFriend from the resultSet.

I want to refactor the response formatter and add a `->get` method to add this functionality.

What do you think @Mulkave ?

                            [body] => Currently, it is not possible to use identifiers in the result to select nodes to work on, for e.g. : 

```MATCH (n:User)-[:FOLLOWS*2]->(fof) RETURN n, collect(fof) AS friendOfFriend;```

with the above query you can not take only the friendOfFriend from the resultSet.

I want to refactor the response formatter and add a `->get` method to add this functionality.

What do you think @Mulkave ?

                            [body] => It is quite easy with the Cypher notation to define tree structure thanks to identifiers: 

    (user:User {email:email} *5)
    (user)-[:filespace *1..1]->(fs:FileSpace *5)
    (fs)-[:contains *1..n]->(file:File {name: randomNumber} *10)
    (fs)-[:contains *1..n]->(folder:Folder {name: randomNumber} *5)
    (folder)-[:contains *1..n]->(file2:File {name: randomNumber} *10)

However with Yaml definition it is something else. If we take an example of something that currently as expected: 

    connection:
      scheme: http
      host: localhost
      port: 7474
    
    nodes:
      users:
        label: User
        count: 5
        properties:
          email: email
      fileSpaces:
          label: FileSpace
          count: 5
      files: 
          label: File
          count: 10
    
    relationships:
      fileSpaceRels:
        start: User
        end: FileSpace
        type: FILESPACE
        mode: 1..1
      fileSpaceContainsFiles: 
        start: FileSpace
        end: File
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n

We see that relationships start and end nodes are described based on the label rather than on the identifier like for the Cypher Query. Adding folders in the later example should be quite easy. However, introducing files inside folder is another story as the relationship description will match files at the root and files that should be in folders at the same time. 

It is somehow possible to have a tree-like structure by cheating using new intermediate labels for nested files. But it's really messy has we cannot make clean Cypher on that tree afterward: 

    connection:
      scheme: http
      host: localhost
      port: 7474
    
    nodes:
      users:
        label: User
        count: 5
        properties:
          email: email
      fileSpaces:
        label: FileSpace
        count: 5
      files: 
        label: File
        count: 10
      folders: 
        label: Folder
        count: 5
      firstLvlFiles:
        label: FirstLvlFile
        count: 15
    
    relationships:
      fileSpaceRels:
        start: User
        end: FileSpace
        type: FILESPACE
        mode: 1..1
      fileSpaceContainsFiles: 
        start: FileSpace
        end: File
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n
      fileSpaceContainsFolders: 
        start: FileSpace
        end: Folder
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n
      foldersContainsFirstLvlFiles: 
        start: Folder
        end: FirstLvlFile
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n
                        )

                            [body] => Hello,

It would be nice if we can return the amount of downloads by version of packages, maybe not for the presentation on the packagist website, but at least at the json api package endpoint.

If you agree on this, I can work on making a P.R.

Cheers,

Chris

                            [body] => Hello,

It would be nice if we can return the amount of downloads by version of packages, maybe not for the presentation on the packagist website, but at least at the json api package endpoint.

If you agree on this, I can work on making a P.R.

Cheers,

Chris

                            [body] => Hi all,

I would like to show up a demo app using this extension. Basically looking at the output format received from your endpoint, it looks like I can easily match patterns using the parser developed for Grahgen.

It would serve as post-processing actions, like executing a script, sending an e-mail when a pattern is matched, or other funny use cases.

In a simple UI, you could add rules for matched patterns (and write it like on graphgen) , for e.g. orders on unavailable products, unregistered users visit secure pages, ... and it adds a post-processing detection layer and is non-breaking for the user experience.

I received btw a question from someone, how is this module reacting on for e.g. 3000/4000 req/s ?

Thanks


Chris

                            [body] => It is quite easy with the Cypher notation to define tree structure thanks to identifiers: 

    (user:User {email:email} *5)
    (user)-[:filespace *1..1]->(fs:FileSpace *5)
    (fs)-[:contains *1..n]->(file:File {name: randomNumber} *10)
    (fs)-[:contains *1..n]->(folder:Folder {name: randomNumber} *5)
    (folder)-[:contains *1..n]->(file2:File {name: randomNumber} *10)

However with Yaml definition it is something else. If we take an example of something that currently as expected: 

    connection:
      scheme: http
      host: localhost
      port: 7474
    
    nodes:
      users:
        label: User
        count: 5
        properties:
          email: email
      fileSpaces:
          label: FileSpace
          count: 5
      files: 
          label: File
          count: 10
    
    relationships:
      fileSpaceRels:
        start: User
        end: FileSpace
        type: FILESPACE
        mode: 1..1
      fileSpaceContainsFiles: 
        start: FileSpace
        end: File
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n

We see that relationships start and end nodes are described based on the label rather than on the identifier like for the Cypher Query. Adding folders in the later example should be quite easy. However, introducing files inside folder is another story as the relationship description will match files at the root and files that should be in folders at the same time. 

It is somehow possible to have a tree-like structure by cheating using new intermediate labels for nested files. But it's really messy has we cannot make clean Cypher on that tree afterward: 

    connection:
      scheme: http
      host: localhost
      port: 7474
    
    nodes:
      users:
        label: User
        count: 5
        properties:
          email: email
      fileSpaces:
        label: FileSpace
        count: 5
      files: 
        label: File
        count: 10
      folders: 
        label: Folder
        count: 5
      firstLvlFiles:
        label: FirstLvlFile
        count: 15
    
    relationships:
      fileSpaceRels:
        start: User
        end: FileSpace
        type: FILESPACE
        mode: 1..1
      fileSpaceContainsFiles: 
        start: FileSpace
        end: File
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n
      fileSpaceContainsFolders: 
        start: FileSpace
        end: Folder
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n
      foldersContainsFirstLvlFiles: 
        start: Folder
        end: FirstLvlFile
        type: CONTAINS
        mode: 1..n
                        )

 * A User has one and only one FileSpace defined.
 * A FileSpace can contains many files.

If you run the following query several times: 

    (user:User {email:email} *5)
    (user)-[:filespace *1..1]->(fs:FileSpace *5)
    (fs)-[:contains *1..n]->(file:File {name: randomNumber} *10)

You will notice that one of the FileSpace always contains 5 files and the others only 1. Is this normal behavior, or the maybe did I miss something in the query?

In the future you'll be able to do more accurate graph definitons, a new GraphEvaluator will be created for it ;-)

                            [body] => Hi all,

I would like to show up a demo app using this extension. Basically looking at the output format received from your endpoint, it looks like I can easily match patterns using the parser developed for Grahgen.

It would serve as post-processing actions, like executing a script, sending an e-mail when a pattern is matched, or other funny use cases.

In a simple UI, you could add rules for matched patterns (and write it like on graphgen) , for e.g. orders on unavailable products, unregistered users visit secure pages, ... and it adds a post-processing detection layer and is non-breaking for the user experience.

I received btw a question from someone, how is this module reacting on for e.g. 3000/4000 req/s ?

Thanks


Chris

This PR adds a [Composer script](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md) that runs during the `post-install-cmd` event to create the missing config dir so that `file_put_contents` won't blow up.

                            [body] => Refactored test suite setup
* Adjusted namespace definition in composer.json
* Corrected namespaces in Neo4jClientMock, as \ before fqdcn are not required when using namespaces correctly
* Added a .travis.yml file for using Travis and having a real db to test on
* Added a Import file to import data when the Slim bootstrap is done

I just need to look a bit deeper of how to bootstrap the app correctly for integration tests.

Running `phpunit` is ok.

Would be cool if merged to add `Travis` service webhook
